# Chandra
Team Chandra's official entry

This project was developed for NASA's space apps challenge by a team of three students and developers from India.
Project Chandra focuses on making the logging system better and easier to use for NASA's flight controllers. We also have a 3D model
of the moon for viewing and planning landing spots.
